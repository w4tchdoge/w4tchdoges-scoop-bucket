This is a Scoop bucket that I made for my personal use.

It will mostly have:
- Manifests for new applications that I either haven't gotten around to submitting to an official Scoop bucket or do not meet the requirements for submission to an official Scoop bucket.
- Fixes for an application in an official bucket that I either haven't gotten around to submitting or have submitted as a PR but are in limbo.
